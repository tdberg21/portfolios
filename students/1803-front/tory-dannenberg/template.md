# (Your Name) - (M1/M2/M3/M4) Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I set out this module to try to be as engaged as I could and learn as much as possible. My goal was to gain a solid base of the fundamentals of coding to build on top of going forward in the next Mods and in my career.

## B: Individual Work & Projects
My individual projects this mod were Number Guesser and three static composition challenges. 

#### Number Guesser

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/tdberg21/number-guesser)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

Description:
Build a game where the user guesses a number between 1 and 100 (or sets their own range and guesses a number in between). The application generates a random number in the range and gives feedback based on if the user guess is too high, too low or correct.

#### Static Comp Challenges

I was given a series of three static compositions and asked to recreate them with a responsive design while respecting the integrity of the original design. The creative license included copy, images, icons and color palette.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects
My paired projects this mod were LinkedList, IdeaBox and 2DoBox. 


#### 2doBox-Pivot

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/andrew-t-james/2DoBox-Pivot/)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/2DoBox-Pivot-Mod1.html)

Description:
Inherit another groups IdeaBox, refactor CSS/jQuery and pivot the application from a list of ideas to a task list manager. 


[Evaluation](https://github.com/turingschool/front-end-submissions-public/blob/master/1803/mod-1/2dobox/tory-andrew.md)


Feedback to me:
I found the working environment between you and I to be very enjoyable. Your work ethic, use of git/github, and knowledge our codebase was paramount in getting our project to the level we finished at. I though it was awesome how we would choose a feature and get to work on it, rinse wash and repeat. If I could pick one thing to focus on to improve it would be communicating. I noticed that communication was sparse until necessary. Otherwise this was the most enjoyable pairing I have had to date and really enjoyed the whole project.


#### IdeaBox

* [GitHub URL](* https://github.com/marikaross/ideabox)
* [Original Assignment](* http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)

Description:
Build an application for recording and archiving ideas. The user should input and store an idea and description and be able to search through, edit, delete and change the quality of each idea. This project focused on providing a fluid and responsive client-side interface by ensuring that the ideas persist on page load.

Feedback to me:
I really liked being your partner on IdeaBox.  Thank you so much for offering to do specific tasks in the project so I didn't have to delegate.  Your jQuery and console.log skills are impressive and it was nice for me to watch the workflow of someone who is more comfortable coding than I am.  It would be a little helpful if you talked through your thought process just a little bit more.  I didn't mind creepily leaning over your shoulder long periods of time, but maybe you didn't like it.  I also really appreciated that we worked hard for the hours we worked together and then took a break and divided up the easier stuff to do on our own.  I dislike spending long hours making little progress and I think you do, too. Thank you for being a fun pairing partner that helped me learn more about jQuery and local storage.


#### LinkedList

* [GitHub URL](* https://github.com/tdberg21/linked-list-project)
* [Original Assignment](* http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)

Description:
Build an application in which a user can input and bookmark a webpage title and URL. Each bookmark should have a "mark to read" button and remove button and user should be able to see a count of all the bookmarks and all the read bookmarks.

[Evaluation](https://github.com/turingschool/front-end-submissions-public/blob/master/1803/mod-1/linked-list/tory-gavin.md)

Feedback to me:
Awesome job on the project! I really appreciated the dedication and time spent figuring things out and applying your skills to the task at hand. The only thing that I noticed we struggled with was css. I think one thing that might help you with future projects would be to place 2 windows side by side, so that you can match the layout of the comp as closely as possible. Thank you for taking the time to make this project a positive experience!


## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up
#### Mental Health 101

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Mod1_Week1_mental_health_101.md)

I really enjoyed this session and learning more about stress. Turing is definitely a stressful environment so this gear-up was particularly helpful. I learned about different types of stress and the affects they have on us and became more aware of when it was happening to me throughout the Mod. Going forward I need to continue to be more aware of stress and utilize the strategies I learned  to combat it. 


#### Code Debugging the Gender Gap

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Mod1_Week3_Code_debugging_compact_version.md)

3-4 t was very interesting hearing different perspectives within the coding community from my classmates. The video we watched raised my awareness of the gender gap amongst programmers. I look forward to continuing the discussion and driving solutions throughout my coding career. 

#### Mindfulness

Very cool that they led Mod 4â€™s teach these. It was fun getting to hear from some different voices who are close to the end of their Turing journey. The session was very helpful, we did some yoga and guided meditation which made me feel much better. I am glad to have learned some tools to calm down my thoughts and how to properly stretch that I will use going forward.  


## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I was an active member of the Turing community and represented our cohort on the Student Advisory Board. Through my role on SAB I helped plan, setup and work two socials and a code fair, and made multiple announcements to the whole school. I attended happy hours to get to know people in the community better, especially people in different mods that I do not normally get a chance to interact with. I love the community here and am looking forward to continuing to participate as much as possible.
